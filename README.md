# Stockr.io

Stockr.io is an application that allows new traders to make informed decision about stock trading through Sentimental Analysis using Natural Language Processing.

## Purpose

It is not uncommon for common folks like you and I to be interested in dabbling in the stock market, eager to flip a profit. But for most of us, we do not know where to begin. With that in mind, the team at Stockr.io decided to implement an interactive application that allows users to input a ticker symbol of their choice and obtain relevant data about how valuable the stock is perceived through various news sources.


## Implementation

This project hacks various libraries and frameworks together in order to create a functioning application that is user-friendly.
